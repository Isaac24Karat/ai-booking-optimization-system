# AI Booking Optimization and Smart Agent Escalation System

> **Project Pitch:**  
> I built an AI-driven system that optimizes online booking flows and customer support for travel transfers.  
> The system intelligently guides users through the booking process, auto-answers frequent questions, and escalates complex cases to human agents — using real-time confidence scoring and CRM integration to maximize speed and satisfaction.

## What It Does
- Receives incoming booking inquiries or support questions
- Classifies intent and routes simple cases to the AI agent
- AI agent answers FAQs, booking edits, cancellations, and transfer confirmations
- If confidence is low or user is unsatisfied, the system escalates to a human agent
- Connects directly to the CRM and booking platform to pull or update real-time customer data
- Uses A/B testing to continuously optimize AI messaging and flow efficiency

---

## Technologies Used
- OpenAI (chat completion and classification)
- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- CRM API Integration (HubSpot, Zoho, or similar)
- Booking system API connection
- LangChain prompt routing (for escalation decision making)
- Confidence score-based escalation triggers
- A/B Testing layer for conversational experiments

## KPIs Measured
- Booking completion rate
- AI self-resolution rate
- Escalation to human (%)
- Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)

## Why This Matters
This system shows how a carefully designed AI agent can enhance customer experience without replacing humans — speeding up bookings, deflecting unnecessary support cases, and increasing customer loyalty.  
It proves real-world AI deployment with measurable business value, aligned with Alps2Alps goals.
